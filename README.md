## 💻 Featured Projects

### 🌟 [Behavior Tree Generator](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/project1)
This project is in collaboration with Lockheed Martin where the goal is to shorten the amount of time it takes to generate behavior trees for the simulation of different military scenarios. This includes the usage of CodeLlama to generate behavior trees so developers can use it as template to integrate them into their workflow.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Language: Javascript, Python, C++
- Backend: Flask
- Database: Pinecone
- Other Tools: bash

**Key Features:**
- Uses CodeLlama LORA Adapter for behavior Tree Generation
- Uses RAG from Pinecone database to provide context to prompt
- Interactive UI that displays the generated Behvaior Tree
- Utilizes multiple node types that are used in Behvaior Tree generation for military scenarios
